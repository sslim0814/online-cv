career-profile:
    title: Postdoctoral Research Associate
    summary: |
     I am currently a postdoctoral Research Associate affiliated with <a href="https://bhi-kimlab.github.io/" style="color:blue" target="_blank">Bio & Health Informatics Lab</a> and <a href="http://nbiosnu.org/" style="color:blue" target="_blank">Bioinformatics Institute</a> at Seoul National University. 
     I received a Ph.D. degree in Bioinformatics at Seoul National University in 2019. 
     My research currently focuses on developing machine learning algorithms to model toxicity of chemicals in large-scale drug discovery data using deep neural networks, identifying toxicophores (hotspots) contributing to the toxicity of chemicals.

#projects:
    #title: Discovery of pharmacophores using an aggregated variable-length convolutional neural networks
    #intro: >
      #In drug design, developing a lead compound requires actual binding motif as an essential building block while meeting supplementary biochemical requirements.
      #To understand where and how a binding motif (also called pharmacophore) can be active, various machine learning algorithms have been suggested including deep neural networks.
      #However, current prediction methods mainly focuses on improving the performance of a model without sufficient interpretation of how actual binding of chemicals induce desired biological activity.
      #Thus, this project is to develop a systematic method using variable-length convolutional neural networks to discover pharmacophores with scoring approahces.
