career-profile:
    title: Postdoctoral Research Associate
    summary: |
     I am currently a postdoctoral Research Associate affiliated with Bio & Health Informatics Lab and Bioinformatics Institute at Seoul National University. 
     I received a Ph.D. degree in Bioinformatics at Seoul National University in 2019. 
     My research currently focuses on developing machine learning algorithms to model toxicity of chemicals in large-scale drug discovery data using deep neural networks, identifying toxicophores (hotspots) contributing to the toxicity of chemicals.
